## Introduction

JWT Auth Example provides a basic implementation of user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The application demonstrates how to register new users, log in with valid credentials, and securely authenticate users for accessing protected resources using JWT tokens.

## Features

- User registration with email and password
- User login with JWT token generation
- Protected routes that require JWT token authentication
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism
- [Add more features specific to your JWT authentication example]

## Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - ReactJS
  - TypeScript
  - Apollo Client (for handling GraphQL on the client-side)
  - [List any additional frontend libraries or frameworks used]

- Backend:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js (as the web server)
  - GraphQL with Apollo Server (for API and JWT authentication)
  - PostgreSQL (as the database)
  - TypeORM (for interacting with the database)
  - [List any additional backend libraries or frameworks used]

## Installation

To run the JWT Auth Example locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/jwt-auth-example.git
$ cd jwt-auth-example

    Set up the frontend:

bash

$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start

    Set up the backend:

bash

$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ npm start

    Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

Make sure to set up the PostgreSQL database and update the necessary configurations for the backend to connect to the database.

Alternatively, you can deploy the frontend and backend on separate servers or use a cloud platform to host the application online.
